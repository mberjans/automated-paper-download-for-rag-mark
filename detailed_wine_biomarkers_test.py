    Wine Biomarker Study Results
    
    Tartaric acid was the most abundant organic acid detected in urine samples after wine consumption.
    Gallic acid concentrations increased significantly 2-4 hours post-consumption.
    Hippuric acid levels showed a dose-dependent response to wine intake.
    Quercetin metabolites were detected in all subjects who consumed red wine.
    Catechin and epicatechin appeared as glucuronide conjugates in urine.
    Resveratrol was found primarily as resveratrol-3-O-glucuronide in post-consumption samples.
    Malvidin-3-glucoside was detected in subjects who consumed anthocyanin-rich red wines.
    Peonidin-3-glucoside levels correlated with the anthocyanin content of consumed wines.
    Citric acid excretion increased following wine consumption in all study participants.
    Malic acid concentrations in urine reflected the malic acid content of consumed wines.
    Caffeic acid metabolites were consistently found in post-wine consumption urine samples.
    4-Hydroxybenzoic acid levels increased significantly after red wine intake.
    Vanillic acid was detected as a metabolite of more complex wine phenolics.
    Protocatechuic acid appeared in urine as a breakdown product of anthocyanins.
    Syringic acid emerged as a specific biomarker for red wine consumption.
    Homovanillic acid levels correlated with wine polyphenol content.
    Ferulic acid conjugates showed increased urinary excretion after wine consumption.
