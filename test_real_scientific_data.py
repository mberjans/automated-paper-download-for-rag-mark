Recent clinical trials have demonstrated that curcumin supplementation significantly reduces inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The bioactive compound exerts its effects through modulation of nuclear factor-Œ∫B signaling pathways and inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 enzyme activity. Furthermore, curcumin has shown promising results in improving joint pain and mobility in arthritis patients when administered at doses of 500-1000 mg daily.",

In vitro studies demonstrate that EGCG crosses the blood-brain barrier and accumulates in brain tissue, where it modulates amyloid-Œ≤ aggregation and tau protein phosphorylation. A randomized controlled trial involving 120 elderly participants showed that daily consumption of 300 mg EGCG for 12 weeks significantly improved cognitive performance on memory tasks and reduced oxidative stress markers in cerebrospinal fluid. The neuroprotective mechanisms involve activation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and inhibition of neuroinflammatory pathways.",

Preclinical studies in animal models demonstrate that resveratrol supplementation increases insulin sensitivity, reduces hepatic steatosis, and extends lifespan through caloric restriction mimetic effects. Human clinical trials have shown that resveratrol administration at 150 mg twice daily for 30 days improves glucose tolerance and reduces systemic inflammation in overweight individuals. The compound's cardioprotective effects are mediated through activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase and reduction of low-density lipoprotein oxidation.",
