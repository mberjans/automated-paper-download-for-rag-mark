The user has provided a text about wine consumption and its associated compounds. My task is to list each compound mentioned explicitly, each on a separate line, without including any that aren't in the text.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the text carefully. It starts by mentioning that wine has bioactive compounds like resveratrol, quercetin, catechin, epicatechin, and anthocyanins. These are all polyphenols, so I should list each of these.\n\nNext, the text talks about metabolites produced when these compounds are metabolized in the body. It specifically mentions 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, vanillic acid, and hippuric acid. These are definitely metabolites, so they should be included.\n\nThen, the text refers to urinary biomarkers, which include tartaric acid and gal",
