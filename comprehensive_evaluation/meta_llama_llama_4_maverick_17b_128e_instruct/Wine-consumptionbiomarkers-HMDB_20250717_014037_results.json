In this study, two metabolomic approaches, targeted and untargeted, were applied to 24-h urine samples \nfrom a cohort of La Rioja (Spain) (aged 52\u201378), comparing moderate and daily wine consumers (20 males and 13 \nfemales) without diet intervention, versus non-consumers (8 males and 35 females). Results showed that the non- \ntargeted metabolomics approach has allowed for the annotation of sixteen compounds in 24-h urine samples \nfrom regular wine-consumers that were not detected in the urine of non-wine consumers. Additionally, the \ntargeted metabolomics approach showed a wide range of phenol metabolites, mainly hepatic phase-II conjugates, \nwhose concentration was significantly higher in the urine of wine consumers. As a novelty, this study focuses on \ndiscovering the main urinary biomarkers of regular wine consumption involving free-living volunteers, without \ndietary intervention or restrictions that might alter their regular behaviors and lifestyles.\n1.Introduction\nModerate wine consumption has been positively correlated with \nbeneficial health effects, including the prevention of cardiovascular \ndiseases, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antiatherogenic effects, \namong others (Fraga et al., 2010 ; Rasouli et al., 2017 ; Esteban-Fern \u02d8an-\ndez et al., 2018 ; Buljeta et al., 2023 ). The beneficial effect of wine seems \nto be ascribed to its polyphenolic content (Esteban-Fern \u02d8andez et al., \n2018 ; Hrelia et al., 2023 ) together with the \u201cMediterranean way of \ndrinking \u201d that means a moderate wine consumption mainly with meals \n(Giacosa et al., 2016 ). After wine intake, polyphenols undergo several \nmetabolic modifications and are extensively metabolized by the liver \nand gut microbiota (Del Rio et al., 2013 ; Esteban-Fern \u02d8andez et al., 2018 ) \nbefore being excreted in urine. According to the literature, a limited \nnumber of compounds have been proposed as good biomarkers of \nmoderate wine consumption, including gallic acid, 4-O-methylgallic \nacid, dihydroxyphenyl valerolactones, ethylgallate, epicatechin, \nphenolic acids and mainly resveratrol metabolites (Zamora-Ros et al., 2009 ; Urpi-Sarda et al., 2015 ; Motilva et al., 2016 ; Mosele & Motilva, \n2021 ). Additionally, Regueiro et al. (2014) reported an increase in tar-\ntaric acid in urine after the consumption of wine, suggesting that urinary \ntartaric acid may be a sensitive and specific biomarker of wine \nconsumption.\nMetabolomic strategies are commonly categorized into two ap-\nproaches, untargeted and targeted metabolomics. Over the last decade, \nthe significance of untargeted metabolomics has increased with prom -\nising results in biomarker seeking in a wide range of field, including \ndietary studies (Esteban-Fern \u02d8andez et al., 2018 ; Lacalle-Bergeron et al., \n2023 ; Low et al., 2019 ; Rebholz et al., 2018 ), drug discovery (Alarc \u02d8on- \nBarrera et al., 2022 ), plant biology (Carreno-Quintero et al., 2012 ) and \nbiomedical research (Yang et al., 2022 ; You et al., 2019 ; Yu et al., 2017 ). \nThis cutting-edge technology could be extremely useful in corroborating \nfood consumption when self-reported dietary assessment methods are \nused, especially in the case of wine, given that individuals may be \nreluctant to report customary drinking levels accurately for a range of \nsocial reasons (Regueiro et al., 2014 ).

The existence of prior \nknowledge of the sample is not a requirement, which is one of the major \nadvantages of this approach (Schrimpe-Rutledge et al., 2016 ). Liquid \nchromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC- \nHRMS) is one of the most suitable techniques for untargeted metab -\nolomics (Odriozola & Corrales, 2015 ), LC enables the separation of a \nwide range of metabolites with a variety of stationary phases available \nand HRMS allows the exact mass identification of compounds with high \nsensitivity and selectivity to confirm the molecular formula of com-\npounds with errors lower than 5 ppm. In contrast, targeted metab -\nolomics is focused on the identification of well-defined groups of \nmetabolites (Leborgne et al., 2022 ). Every parameter of the analysis \n(ionization energy, selection of the m/z, etc.) can be customized and \noptimized for the detection of each compound. Meanwhile, in untar -\ngeted metabolomics, a compromise must be reached to optimize the \nconditions of the experiment, since every compound will need different \nparameters and there is no knowledge of the compounds present in the \nsample. Subsequently, combined use of both metabolomics strategies \ncould be promising for exploring the compounds present in the samples.\nTo date, most of the works that have studied the effect of polyphenols \non health are based on diet intervention studies (Annuzzi et al., 2014 ; \nBelda et al., 2021 ; Esteban-Fern \u02d8andez et al., 2018 ; Esteban-Fern \u02d8andez \net al., 2020 ; Noad et al., 2016 ; Vetrani et al., 2020 ). Thus phenol intake \nbiomarkers can be identified accurately mainly by targeted metab -\nolomics. Moreover, the appropriate use of specific food biomarkers in \nclinical and epidemiologic studies requires the previous validation in the \nfree-living population (Zamora-Ros et al., 2009 ). A limitation of studies \nwithout diet intervention is related to inter-individual variability. \nConsequently, drawing conclusions might be an arduous task.\nBased on this background, we hypothesize that untargeted metab -\nolomics may serve as an effective tool for identifying new biomarkers \nassociated with wine consumption, as it facilitates the qualitative \nidentification and relative quantification of thousands of endogenous \nmetabolites in biological samples. Prior knowledge of the sample is not a \nrequirement, which is one of the major advantages of this approach. \nAdditionally, urine samples have drawn increasing attention in \nbiomarker discovery because, compared with other biofluids, such as \nplasma and serum, they can be obtained non-invasively. In this study, \ntargeted and untargeted metabolomics were applied to study the \nmetabolite profile of 24-h human urine samples, comparing those from \nregular wine consumers and from non-consumers (aged 52\u201378) in a \ncohort in La Rioja (Spain). The targeted metabolomics approach was \nperformed (LC-triple-quadrupole) for supervised analysis and quantifi -\ncation of the wine phenolic metabolites excreted in the 24-h urine \nsamples. Untargeted metabolomics was performed by UPLC-QTOF-MS \ncombining RP and HILIC. As a novelty, this study focuses on discov -\nering the main urinary biomarkers of regular wine consumption \ninvolving free-living volunteers without dietary intervention or re-\nstrictions that could influence their usual behaviors and lifestyles.\n2.Materials and methods\n2.1. Chemicals and reagents\nLC-MS grade acetonitrile (ACN) and LC-MS grade ammonium for-\nmiate were from Carlo Erba (Sabadell, Barcelona, Spain). Formic acid \neluent additive for the LC-MS grade was purchased from VWR (Radnor, \nPennsylvania, USA). Methanol (HPLC grade), acetic acid (HPLC grade), \nand hydrochloric acid were purchased from Scharlab Chemie (Sentme -\nnat, Catalonia, Spain). The ultrapure water was supplied by a MilliQ \nsystem (Millipore Corp, Bedford, MA, USA). Leucine-enkephalin (mass- \naxis calibration) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Saint Louis, MO, \nUSA). The analytical standards used in targeted metabolomics are \ndescribed in Supplementary Material (Supplementary Material Text S1). \nStock solutions of standard compounds were prepared by dissolving each compound in methanol at a concentration of 1000 mg/L, which \nwere then stored in dark flasks at \u000020 \u2022C.\n2.2. Human subjects\nOne hundred and three participants aged 52\u201378 were recruited from \nFebruary 2021 to September 2022 in the Hospital San Pedro in Logro ~no, \nLa Rioja (Spain). All participants signed informed consent statements to \nparticipate in the study. The participants had no diet intervention and \nmaintained their usual daily activities, dietary habits and social in-\nteractions, so they could be considered \u201cfree-living population \u201d. Their \ndietary habits were assessed using a semi-quantitative 136-item Food \nFrequency Questionnaire (FFQ) previously validated for the Spanish \npopulation (De La Fuente-Arrillaga et al., 2010 ). Participants were asked \nhow often, on average, they had consumed specific foods and beverages \nwith pre-specified portion sizes during the preceding year, also consid -\nering seasonal variations and differences between weekday and week -\nend patterns. Each food included in the questionnaire specified the \nserving size and offered nine options for frequency of consumption, from \n\u201cnever or almost never \u201d to \u201cmore than six times a day\u201d. In particular, the \nFFQ includes questions related to the frequency of wine intake. Based on \nthe FFQ answers, among the 103 volunteers who made up the cohort, we \nselected the 24-h urine samples from individuals who consumed wine on \na daily basis (1\u20134 glasses wine/day), excluding individuals with spo-\nradic and weekend consumers. Two groups were stablished: (i) regular \nconsumers (33 participants, 20 males and 13 females) and (ii) non- \nconsumers (43 participants, 8 males and 35 females) who never \nconsumed wine (the control group). In addition, the complete FFQ was \nused to extract the questions included in the 14-items of the Mediter -\nranean Diet Adherence Score (MEDAS) (Schr\u007foder et al., 2011 ). All the \nvolunteers (wine consumers and non-consumers) in the study adhered \nclosely to the Mediterranean diet (\u227d9). Urine samples were collected \nfrom each participant for 24 h. To control risk of bacterial growth, \nimmediately after collection, each 24-h urine samples was coded, \ndivided into aliquots of 10 mL in Falcon tubes and stored at \u000080 \u2022C until \nits chromatographic analysis. This ensures that the samples were prop-\nerly preserved to minimize the risk of bacterial contamination and \ninterference with the metabolomic analysis. This study was framed \nwithin the WineGut_BrainUP Project (PID2019-108851RB-C22), and it \nwas approved by the Committee for Ethics in Drug Research in La Rioja, \nSpain (Reference CEImLAR P.I. 437). The study was conducted in \naccordance with The Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association \n(Declaration of Helsinki), and the UNESCO Universal Declaration on \nBioethics and Human Rights.\n2.3. Targeted metabolomics analysis of 24-h urine and statistical analysis\nBefore the chromatographic analysis, the urine samples were pre- \ntreated by micro-Elution solid-phase extraction (\u03bcSPE) using OASIS \nHLB (2 mg) (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) microcartridges. The method -\nology used was reported in a previous study (Motilva et al., 2016 ).\nThe urine samples were analyzed by ultra-high-performance liquid \nchromatography with triple-quadrupole mass spectrometry (UHPLC/ \nQqQ-MS/MS) based on the method described by (Royo et al., 2021 ). \nThree replicates of each sample were performed and each replicate was \nanalyzed once. The LC analyses were carried out on a Shimadzu Nexera \nliquid chromatograph (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan), coupled \nto an AB Sciex 3200QTRAP \u00ae mass spectrometer (AB Sciex, Old Con-\nnecticut Path Framingham, MA, USA). The analytical column used was a \nWaters AcQuity BEH C18 (100 mm \u00d72.1 mm i.d., 1.7 \u03bcm,) equipped \nwith a VanGuard \u2122 Pre-Column Acquity BEH C18 (5 \u00d72.1 mm, 1.7 \u03bcm) \nfrom Waters (Milford, MA, USA). The mobile phase solvents and the \nelution gradients were as described in Royo et al. (2021) . Tandem MS \nanalyses were carried out on a 3200QTRAP triple quadrupole mass \nspectrometer (AB Sciex, USA) equipped with an electrospray ionization \nsource (ESI Turbo V\u2122 Source). Ionization was achieved using the M. Jim\u02d8enez-Salcedo et al.

For each chromatographic \npeak, two multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) transitions were studied, \nthe most sensitive one being selected for quantification and a second one \nfor confirmation purposes. For each compound, the retention time (RT) \nand the MRM transitions for quantification and identification, respec -\ntively, are shown in Table S1 of Supplementary Material. Data acquisi -\ntion was carried out with the Analyst \u00ae 1.6.2 software (AB Sciex, USA). \nCompounds were identified by comparing their chromatographic \nbehavior and mass spectra with those of authentic standards and the \nliterature data. When no standards were available, the phenolic me-\ntabolites were identified by using the MS detector system. Subsequently, \nin order to determine their MRMs, MS analyses of these samples were \ncarried out. These were based on the full-scan mode in the MS mode, and \nthe daughter scan mode in the MS/MS mode according with the pro-\ncedure described in Royo et al. (2021) .\nSome of the compounds were quantified using the calibration curves \nof their corresponding commercial standards. The other compounds \nwere tentatively quantified using the calibration curves of standards \nwith similar chemical structures (Table S1 of Supplementary Material). \nThe results were expressed as nmols (anthocyanin metabolites) and \n\u03bcmols (rest of phenolic metabolites) excreted in 24-h urine, taking into \naccount the total volume of urine collected in 24 h for each volunteer. \nStatistical comparisons between groups (wine consumers and non- \nconsumers) were performed using Student's t-test. Differences were \nconsidered significant at a level of p D0.05.\n2.4. Untargeted metabolomics analysis of 24-h urine and statistical \nanalysis\nPrior to analysis, the urine samples were pre-treated following the \nprotocol described previously by Want et al. (2010) with some modifi -\ncations. Briefly, each urine sample was diluted 1:10 (v/v) with formic \nacid 0.1 % (RP) or acetonitrile (HILIC) in duplicate. The samples were \ncentrifuged at 20000 g for 10 min at 4 \u2022C to eliminate particles, and \nfiltered with a 0.22 \u03bcm PVDF filter (Scharlab; Barcelona, Spain). Quality \ncontrol (QC) samples (pool of the 24-h urine samples from all volun -\nteers) were prepared to evaluate the reproducibility of the analysis.\nThe urine samples were analyzed using a Waters Acquity \u2122 Ultra \nPerformance LC system coupled to a Synapt XS HDMS mass spectrom -\neter (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) equipped with an electrospray source \noperating in positive (ESI\u0087) and negative (ESI-) modes. Two chro-\nmatographic separations were employed to cover the range of com-\npound polarities. The reverse phase liquid chromatography (RP-LC) was \nused for the separation of semi-polar and non-polar compounds. For \nboth ionization modes, positive and negative, a (2.1 \u00d7100 mm \u00d71.8 \n\u03bcm) HSS T3 Acquity premier (Waters) column with the same pre-column \ncomposition was used. The injection volume was 0.3 \u03bcL and the sepa-\nration was performed at 0.5 mL/min and 40 \u2022C. The sampler tempera -\nture was set at 8 \u2022C. The mobile phase was water (A) and acetonitrile (B), \nboth with 0.1 % formic. The elution gradient was as follows: 1 % B until \n1 min, then the gradient increased to 15 % B at 3 min, 50 % B at 6 min, \n95 % B at 9 min and it was held there for one minute until 10 min, finally \n1 % B at 10.1 min.\nIn the hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) \n(negative ionization mode), an Acquity UPLC \u00ae BEH HILIC column (1.7 \n\u03bcm \u00d72.1 \u00d7100 mm) (Waters) was used with an Acquity UPLC BEH \nHILIC VanGuard pre-column (1.7 \u03bcm \u00d72.1 mm \u00d75 mm). The injection \nvolume was 0.3 \u03bcL and the flow rate was 0.5 mL/min and 40 \u2022C. The \nsampler temperature was set at 8 \u2022C. The mobile phase was 10 mM \nammonium formiate in water (A) and acetonitrile (B). The gradient \nstarted with 95 % B, then it decreased to 82 % B at 9 min, 40 % B at 17 \nmin and it was held there for one minute until 18 min. Then the gradient \nincreased to 95 % B at 19 min and was held there to equilibrate with a \ntotal run time of 30 min.The samples were randomly injected to avoid biases and potential \nsequence effects during analysis. To generate a random order list for the \nsamples, we used the online tool Random.org (https://www.random. \norg/). This approach ensured that samples were not introduced in the \nchromatography sequence according to the volunteer number or \nexperimental group. This randomization minimized the risk of order- \nbased errors and prevented any unintentional patterning in sample in-\njection. Additionally, we included a quality control (QC) sample every \n10 samples to monitor and maintain the stability and reproducibility of \nthe instrumentation throughout the analysis. The inclusion of QCs at this \nfrequency allowed us to detect any possible instrumental drift, thereby \nensuring the robustness of the results obtained.\nApart from that, prior to the analysis of the urine samples, 10 and 15 \nQC injections were used for column stabilization in RP-LC and HILIC, \nrespectively. These QC analyses for column stabilization were not \nconsidered for retention time alignment. Mass spectrometry data were \ncollected in the continuum format using electrospray ionization (ESI) \nover an m/z range of 50\u20131200. The capillary and sampling cones were \nset to 1.75 kV and 40 V respectively for RP-LC and HILIC-neg. The source \ntemperature was set at 120 \u2022C and the desolvation temperature at \n500 \u2022C. The gas flow rates were set at 800 L/h for the desolvation gas \nand 50 L/h for the cone gas, and the nebulizer gas was fixed at 600 KPa. \nThe mass spectrometer was set to acquire in resolution mode with a scan \ntime of 0.2 s. Fragment ion information was acquired using a collision \nenergy ramp from 20 to 40 V. Calibration was performed by infusing \nleucine enkephalin at 10 \u03bcL/min through a lockspray probe and ac-\nquired every 30 s. Lockmass correction was [M \u0087H]\u0087\u0088556.2771 for \nthe positive mode, and for negative mode, [M \u0000H]\u0000\u0088554.2615.\nThe raw data were imported into the Progenesis QI software (Waters, \nMilford, MA, USA) for baseline filter, peak alignment, retention time \nalignment and response normalization. The software employed the QC \nreplicates as references to perform retention time alignment automati -\ncally. The conditions for peak peaking were set as follows: all runs, limits \n(automatic), sensitivity (level 4), and chromatographic peak width \n(minimum of 0.1 min). To perform the deconvolution, the following \nadduct ion forms were selected for negative ionization analysis: [M-H]\u0000, \n[M \u0087Cl]\u0000, [M-2H]2\u0000, [2 M-H]\u0000, [M-H 2O-H]\u0000and [M \u0087FA-H]\u0000. For \npositive ionization analysis these were [M \u0087H]\u0087, [M \u00872H]2\u0087, [M \u0087H- \nH2O]\u0000, [M\u0087]\u0087, [M \u0087NH4]\u0087, [M \u0087Na]\u0087, [M \u0087K]\u0087, [2 M \u0087H]\u0087and [2 \nM \u0087Na]\u0087.\nThe samples were divided into two groups (non-consumers and \nconsumers of wine) in the \u201cExperimental design setup \u201d, following the \n\u201cBetween-subject Design \u201d comparison. Processed data were then \nexported to EZinfo (V3.03, Umetrics, Sweden). Firstly, Principal \nComponent Analysis (PCA) was used to ensure the correct grouping of \nthe quality control (QC) replicate samples and the absence of outliers. \nOrthogonal partial least square discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) was \nthen applied to maximize the separation between the groups and high-\nlight the most robust markers. The separation achieved was acceptable, \nwith coefficients for variance explained (R2Y) ranging from 67 to 99 % \nand coefficients for variance predicted (Q2) ranging from 43 to 91 % \n(Table 1). With those selected conditions, the Progenesis QI software \nperformed a one-way ANOVA calculation and a false discovery rate \n(FDR) optimization approach to test the differences between the two \nTable 1 \nParameters of OPLS-DA models.\nRP-pos RP-neg HILIC-neg\nComponents 14 12 4\nVariance explained R2Y (cum) 99 % 98 % 67 %\nVariance predicted Q2 (cum) 88 % 91 % 43 %\nScaling pareto pareto pareto\nRP: Reverse Phase liquid chromatography.\nHILIC: Hydrophilic Interaction Liquid Chromatography.\npos: positive (ESI\u0087) ionization mode; neg: negative ionization (ESI-) mode.M.

Statistical significance was set at 95 % (considering significance \nfor the q-value D0.05, adjusted p-value using the FDR approach to \ndiscard false positives). S-plots were generated to visualize the 24-h \nurine markers with discrimination power between the two groups, \nregular wine drinkers and non-consumers (control). Ideally, the most \nrelevant markers are features closer to p(corr) 1 or \u00001. In this study, a \ncut-off p(corr) \u227d\u00b10.3 and p[1] loadings \u227d\u00b10.1 were employed. It \nshould be noted that a specific nutritional intervention with wine was \nnot carried out in this work. Hence it was a real-life situation and wine \nconsumption was self-reported through the FFQ. The selected markers \nwith their corresponding tags (wine or no-wine consumption) were \nimported again into Progenesis QI, and the elucidation process was \nlimited to compounds with a q-value lower than 0.05. The most signif -\nicant markers highlighted in the OPLS-DA with q-values of less than 0.5 \nwere tentatively identified based on their accurate masses and spectra \ninformation. Outliers were identified using Hotelling's ellipse. The \nMetlin, Metabolic Profiling CCS and ChemSpider (databases: phenol- \nexplorer, KEGG, Human Metabolome Database (HMDB), FooDB, Urine \nMetabolome Database) libraries allowed the annotation of the urine \nmetabolites.\n3.Results and discussion\nOne of the main strengths of this study is that the volunteers \nparticipating in this study are from La Rioja, a wine producing region in \nthe north of Spain. La Rioja is a little and rural region, so the study \nparticipants (regular and daily wine consumers and non-consumers) \nhave similar dietary patterns, age and life habits, which makes it a \nvery homogeneous population from a metabolomics point of view. Wine \nwas part of their daily diet and Mediterranean life style in the consumer \ngroup, which made the search for specific wine intake biomarkers more \ncomplex because the concentration of specific metabolites in biological \nfluids should be lower than those analyzed in studies with wine diet \nintervention.\n3.1. Wine phenolic metabolites quantified in 24-h urine samples by \ntargeted metabolomic\nA wide range of compounds (listed in Supplementary material \nTable S1) were studied in the 24-h urine samples. Some of these phenolic \nmetabolites are common to other polyphenol-rich foods. That is why \nmore attention was paid in this study to specific phenolic compounds \nexcreted in 24-h urine that could be used as biomarkers for wine intake. \nA large number of phenolic metabolites are generated from the main \nphenolic groups (anthocyanins, phenolic acids, flavan-3-ols and stil-\nbenes) present in red wine (Zamora-Ros et al., 2009 ; Urpi-Sarda et al., \n2015 ; Motilva et al., 2016 ; Mosele & Motilva, 2021 ). In the present \nstudy, some of the metabolites determined in the urine samples were \ncommon to wine non-consumer and consumer groups (Supplementary \nmaterial Table S2). Nevertheless, Table 2shows the phenolic metabo -\nlites excreted in significantly higher concentrations in the 24-h urine of \nwine consumers. The main anthocyanin metabolite excreted in urine \nwas the phase-II hepatic metabolite, malvidin-3-glucuronide (Table 2), \nwhose concentration was significantly higher (p D0.001) in the urine of \nwine consumers. Malvidins are the main anthocyanins in red wine that \ncontribute to its color and antioxidant properties (Royo et al., 2021 ). \nInterestingly, some of the native structures of anthocyanin-glucosides \n(malvidin, peonidin and delphinidin) present in red wine were \nexcreted in higher concentrations in the 24-h urine samples of wine \nconsumers. Note that delphinidin-3-arabinoside and trans-delphinidin- \n3-(6\u2033-coumaroyl)-glucoside were only detected in the 24-h urine of wine \nconsumers, so they could be considered good candidates as specific \nbiomarkers of red wine consumption.\nRegarding the phenolic acids excreted in 24-h urine, different com-\npounds were detected in higher concentrations in wine consumers \n(Table 2). They might arise from phenolic acids present in wine and other small molecules, these being degradation products (colonic \nfermentation) of other larger polyphenols, such as proanthocyanidins \n(Motilva et al., 2016 ). In the group of phenolic acid metabolites, gallic \nacid sulfate was the most abundant and significant metabolite excreted \nin 24-h urine of wine consumers (Table 2). The relationship between \ngallic acid sulfate and wine consumption is indirect but can be traced \nthrough the consumption of grapes and grape-derived products, such as \nwine, after phase-II metabolism. The urine showed a notable increase in \nthe excretion of caffeic acid ethyl ester, protocatechuic acid ethyl ester, \nethyl-gallate and syringic acid, among others, in the wine consumption \ngroup. Note that ethyl-gallate was only detected in the urine of wine \nconsumers.\nProcyanidins are present in grape seeds, skins, and stems, and \ncontribute to the bitterness and astringency of red wine.

Food Chemistry  469 (2025)  142128  \n4 metabolism of catechin, and various conjugated forms of methyl -\ncatechin were found in greater abundance in the 24-h urine of wine \nconsumers. On the other hand, stilbenes are phenolic compounds \nderived from the phenylalanine pathway in the grapevine metabolism. \nRed wine is one of the major dietary sources of stilbenes for human \nnutrition, especially in European countries (Benbouguerra et al., 2021 ). \nAmong the commonly identified stilbenes, resveratrol is the most pop-\nular compound and a recognized biomarker for wine consumption \n(Trius-Soler et al., 2023 ; Zamora-Ros et al., 2009 ). In this work, the \nconcentration of trans-resveratrol conjugated after phase-II hepatic \nmetabolism, predominantly in its sulfate form, was significantly higher \n(p D0.001) in the group of wine consumers. Note the high concentration \nof dihydroresveratrol and dihydroresveratrol sulfate, its conjugated \nphase-II metabolite, detected in the 24-h urine of the wine consumer \ngroup. Finally, urolithin A, a metabolite of ellagitannins resulted from \nthe colonic microbiota metabolism, was detected in higher concentra -\ntions in the wine consumer group. The connection between urolithin A \nand wine consumption lies in the fact that ellagic acid is present in red \nwine. It is important to note that the capacity to produce urolithin A \nfrom ellagic acid and the extent of this production can vary between \nindividuals and depends on variations in gut microbiota composition \n(Esp\u00edn et al., 2013 ). However, the differences in the urine concentration \nof urolithin A between wine consumers and non-consumers were lower \nthan for other metabolites detected in this study (Table 2), so it might \nnot be proposed as an exclusive biomarker for wine consumption.\n3.2. Study of wine intake biomarkers in 24-h urine samples by untargeted \nmetabolomics\nThe RP-positive ionization (RP-pos), RP-negative ionization (RP- \nneg) and HILIC-negative ionization (HILIC-neg) chromatographic ana-\nlyses were performed independently and the annotation of markers was \ndone for each chromatographic approach. Fig. 1A shows the PCA score \nplots of wine consumers and non-wine consumers and Fig. 1B shows the \nOPLS-DA score plots of wine consumers vs. non consumers. Outliers \nwere identified using Hotelling's ellipse. According to what is described in the Material and Methods (Section 2.4), the selected markers with \ntheir corresponding tags wine or non-wine consumers were imported \ninto Progenesis QI, and the elucidation process was limited to com-\npounds with a q-value lower than 0.05. Based on these criteria, Table 3\nshows the selected compounds that have been tentatively annotated \nbased on exact mass, MSMS spectra and databases (phenol-explorer, \nKEGG, Human Metabolome Database (HMDB), FooDB, Urine Metab -\nolome Database), and that could be proposed as wine-consumption \nbiomarkers (q-valueD0.05). Every proposal was supported by the frag-\nments detected in the MSMS spectrum, and the annotation of the me-\ntabolites was done with mass accuracy lower than 5 ppm. Additionally, \nSupplementary Material Table S3 shows features detected in the 24-h \nurine samples of wine-consumers (q-valueD0.05) which could not be \nannotated based on exact mass, MSMS spectra or databases.\nRegarding HILIC-neg analyses, more features were detected \ncompared with the RP, probably related to the high-water content of the \nurine samples (95 %) (Sarigul et al., 2019 ). The first compound anno-\ntated (m/z 291.018) was 3-(3-Hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)-2-(sulfooxy) \npropanoic acid (Table 3) that corresponds with dihydroferulic acid \nconjugated with a sulfate group to favor its urinary excretion. The \npresence of ferulic acid 4-O-sulfate has been previously reported in \nplasma and urine samples after cranberry juice consumption and has \nbeen described in grape seed (Feliciano et al., 2016 ). In this study, the \ndihydroferulic acid sulfate could be derived from the direct absorption \nand conjugation of hydroxycinnamic acids present in the wine, and also \nfrom the colonic metabolism of other flavonoids in the wine, mainly \nanthocyanins (Motilva et al., 2016 ). Moreover, other isomers of that \ncompound, such as 3-[3-Hydroxy-5-methoxy-4-(sulfooxy)phenyl]propa -\nnoic acid, could also be candidates. On the other hand, the m/z 291.018 \nwas annotated as 2-Hydroxy-6-methoxy-4-vinylphenyl hydrogen sulfate \n(adduct [M \u0087FA-H]\u0000) that might be generated during the colonic \nfermentation of wine procyanidins. However, this annotation could not \nbe explained as properly as the previous one according to the fragments \ndetected in the MS/MS spectrum of the compound.\nThe compound eluted at 0.86 min was annotated as equol (Table 3). \nEquol is a colonic metabolite generated from soy isoflavones, daidzein \nFig. 1.PCA scores plots and OPLS-DA analysis. (A) The PCA score plots of wine consumers and non-consumers; (B) OPLS-DA score plots of wine consumers vs non- \nconsumers. The samples of wine consumers (red boxplots) and non-wine consumers (black boxplots) are represented in order to evaluate the overall status, dis-\ntribution, and to maximize inter-group discrimination. Outliers were identified using Hotelling's ellipse. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure \nlegend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)M. Jim\u02d8enez-Salcedo et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Food Chemistry  469 (2025)  142128  \n5 and genistein (V\u02d8azquez et al., 2020 ). Nevertheless, the presence of \ngenistein and daidzein has been described in white wine grapes (De \nSanctis et al., 2012 ) and they have been identified in samples of urine \nafter wine consumption (Noh et al., 2017 ), which could explain the \npresence of equol in the urine samples of wine-consumers in the present \nstudy. Additionally, the metabolite 3-[1-Hydroxy-2-(2-hydroxyphenyl) \nethyl]-5-methoxyphenol, corresponding to the adduct [M-H 2O-H]\u0000\nwith formula C15H16O4, might be an alternative proposal. However, \nthere is nothing in the literature about the relationship between this \ncompound and wine, so equol would be the most feasible proposal.\nThe next compound (RT 0.87 min) was assigned to a [M-H]\u0000adduct \nwhich corresponds to the molecular formula C14H12O3 that was anno-\ntated to resveratrol, one of the most characteristic phenolic compounds \nin the grapevine and wine. Different studies have detected resveratrol-3- \nO-glucuronide in urine after dietary supplementation with wine (Mosele \n& Motilva, 2021 ; Zamora-Ros et al., 2009 ). It has therefore been pro-\nposed as a good biomarker of wine consumption. However, the free form \nof resveratrol has yet to be described in 24-h urine. Nevertheless, \nresveratrol in its free form could be generated in the ionization source \ndue to a breakdown of the resveratrol glucuronide. At 0.88 min, the \ncompound 6-Hydroxy-4 \u2032,5,7-trimethoxyflavone was annotated with an error of 1.28 ppm. This compound is a flavone derived from scutellarein, \nwhich is functionally related to apigenin. Apigenin is present in \nnumerous beverages, including wine, beer and tea. The next compound \ndetected was eluted at 0.92 min. It could be tentatively annotated as \nisohelenol with a 3.89 ppm error. Isohelenol is a sesquiterpene lactone \nthat has not previously been reported in wine. Nevertheless, wine con-\ntains several sesquiterpenes that contribute to its spicy and woody notes \n(Cincotta et al., 2015 ). At 0.93 min, a compound with formula \nC11H18N4O3 was annotated as the dipeptide Valine-Histidine (Val-His). \nThe next one, gravolenic acid, was proposed for the signal at m/z \n261.0777 (RT 1.01 min) with an error of 3.03 ppm (Table 3). It belongs \nto the hydroxycinnamic acid family (coumaric acids), which are abun -\ndant in wine. At 1.02 min, the m/z 411.0031 signal was detected, which \nmight correspond to the adduct [M \u0087FA-H]\u0000and a C15H10O9S molec -\nular formula with a 0.96 ppm mass error. For this formula, the com-\npound luteolin 7-sulfate was proposed. Luteolin is a polyphenol reported \nin wine (Fang et al., 2007 ) and in urinary metabolome after moderate \nred-wine consumption in an interventional period of 28 days (Esteban- \nFern\u02d8andez et al., 2018 ).\nThe following compound proposed as wine-intake biomarker (q- \nvalueD0.05) was detected at 1.22 min (Table 3). Several compounds Table 3 \nCompounds detected by untargeted metabolomic approach in 24-h urine samples of wine consumers group that could be proposed as wine-intake biomarkers (q- \nvalueD0.05) and tentatively annotated on exact mass, MSMS spectra and databases.\nCompound RT \n(min)m/z Molecular \nformulaError \n(ppm)Adduct MSMS fragments Chromatography/ \nESI\n3-(3-Hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)-2-(sulfooxy) \npropanoic acid \n(Dihydroferulic acid sulfate)0.85 291.0183 C10H12O8S 1.01 [M-H]\u0000188.0087, 135.0440, 79.9563 HILIC-neg\n3-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)chroman-7-ol (Equol)  \n3-[1-Hydroxy-2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)ethyl]-5- \nmethoxyphenol0.86 241.0881 C15H14O3  \nC15H16O44.26  \n3.99[M-H]\u0000\n[M-H 2O- \nH]\u0000107.0494, 93.0337 HILIC-neg\nResveratrol 0.87 227.0718 C14H12O3 1.71 [M-H]\u0000107.0494, 187.0060, 172.9902, \n93.0345HILIC-neg\n6-Hydroxy-4 \u2032,5,7-trimethoxyflavone 0.88 271.0988 C18H16O6 1.28 [M-H 2O- \nH]\u0000187.0059, 107.0493, 172.9902, \n135.0439HILIC-neg\n(4S,4aR,7aR,8R,9aR)-4-Hydroxy-3-(hydroxymethyl)- \n4a,8-dimethyl-4,4a,7a,8,9,9a-hexahydroazuleno[6,5- \nb]furan-2,5-dione (Isohelenol)0.92 259.0987 C15H18O5 3.89 [M-H 2O- \nH]\u0000183.0111, 112.9845, 173.9857 HILIC-neg\nValine-Histidine (Val-His) 0.93 282.0976 C11H18N4O3 4.19 [M \u0087\nCl]\u0000183.0110, 150.0553, 173.9857, \n230.0116HILIC-neg\n(2Z)-3-[4,5-Dihydroxy-2-(2-hydroxy-2-propanyl)-2,3- \ndihydro-1-benzofuran-7-yl]acrylic acid (Gravolenic \nacid)1.01 261.0777 C14H16O6 3.03 [M-H 2O- \nH]\u0000226.0263, 183.0108, 96.9590, \n79.9566, 124.9904, 152.0104, \n164.0044, 198.0314HILIC-neg\n2-(3,4-Dihydroxyphenyl)-5-hydroxy-4-oxo-4H- \nchromen-7-yl hydrogen sulfate (Luteolin 7-sulfate)1.02 411.0031 C15H10O9S 0.96 [M \u0087\nFA-H]\u0000277.1844, 150.0311, 263.0219, \n121.0284, 399.1825HILIC-neg\nCitramalic acid; Beta-lactic acid; Erythro-3-methylmalic \nacid; Threo-3-methylmalic acid; other isomers1.22 129.0186 C5H8O5\u00004.88 [M-H 2O- \nH]\u0000112.9845, 68.9947, 110.9830 HILIC-neg\np-coumaryl alcohol 4-O-glucoside 2.05 311.1146 C15H20O7\u00003.06 [M-H]\u0000178.0497, 134.0598, 197.0665, \n166.0165, 311.1143, 159.0451HILIC-neg\n2-amino-3-oxoadipic acid; N-formyl-L-glutamic acid 2.42 156.0294 C6H9NO5\u00004.94 [M-H 2O- \nH]\u0000113.0231, 85.0284, 107.0491, \n149.0445, 71.0128, 95.0127, \n99.0080, 101.0234HILIC-neg\nGalactopinitol A; Galactopinitol B 4.40 337.1134 C13H24O11\u00001.78[M-H 2O- \nH]\u0000133.0492, 316.9474, 85.0285, \n178.9910, 221.1537HILIC- \nneg\nMethyl (2E)-5-(5-methyl-2-thienyl)-2-penten-4-ynoate 1.62 187.0224 C11H10O2S 0.41[M-H 2O- \nH]\u000096.9585, 247.8403, 194.9253, \n168.8880RP-neg\nVanillic acid-4- O-glucuronide; 1-Caffeoyl-beta- D-glucose; Caffeic \nacid 3-glucoside  \n1-O-[3-(2,4-Dihydroxy-methoxyphenyl)propanoyl] \nhexopyranuronic acid; 4-(2-Carboxyethyl)-3-hydroxy-2- \nmethoxyphenyl hexopyranosiduronic acid4.38 387.0931C15H18O9   \nC16H20O11\u00000.50   \n\u00000.39[M \u0087FA- \nH]\u0000\n[M-H]\u0000146.9638, 113.0225, 85.0278, \n383.1911, 191.0542, 61.9871, \n358.0530, 196.0357RP-neg\nXanthine 1.45 152.0338 C5H4N4O2 2.22[M \u0087Na]\u0087, \n[M \u0087K]\u0087110.0329, 153.0387, 136.0125, \n70.0634, 142.0842, 173.0494, \n107.0471, 97.9663RP-pos\nO-adipoylcarnitine; 3-Methylglutarylcarnitine 3.27 290.1585 C13H23NO6\u00004.67 [M \u0087H]\u0087118.0631, 143.0709, 188.0686, \n146.0581, 115.0522, 130.0631, \n290.1581, 73.0285RP-posM.

Food Chemistry  469 (2025)  142128  \n6 were tentatively annotated for the signal m/z 129.0186, these being \ncitramalic acid, beta-lactic acid, erythro-3-methylmalic acid, threo-3- \nmethylmalic acid and other isomers. All of these are supported by the \nMSMS spectrum and it is plausible for them to be found in wine derived \nfrom the malolactic fermentation. The next compound (2.05 min) \ndetected in the 24-h urine samples of wine-consumers could be tenta -\ntively annotated as p-coumaryl alcohol 4-O-glucoside. This is a \nhydroxycinnamic acid belonging to the coumarin family, a group of \ncompounds known to possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory prop-\nerties. p-Coumaryl alcohol 4-O-glucoside could be generated from cou-\nmaric acid (van Summeren-Wesenhagen et al., 2015 ), which is present \nin grapes and wine (Salameh et al., 2008 ) and has been previously re-\nported in urinary metabolome as a biomarker of wine consumption (Noh \net al., 2017 ). At 2.42 min, two compounds, 2-amino-3-oxoadipidic acid \nand N-formyl-L-glutamic acid, have been annotated for the adduct [M- \nH2O-H]\u0000with the molecular formula C6H9NO5. The last compound \nannotated in HILIC-neg eluted at 4.40 min and it may tentatively \ncorrespond to galactopinitol A or B (Table 3). This compound has been \nreported as a biomarker of soy and pulse consumption according to the \nHMDB and FooDB databases. Nevertheless, to date, this has not been \nreported in wine or studies related to wine consumption.\nIn the reverse phase chromatography few significant signals (q-val -\nueD0.05) were detected (Table 3), and only two compounds were \ntentatively annotated in RP-neg, apart from galactopinitol, which was \nalso detected in the HILIC-neg chromatography. The first one, eluted at \n1.62 min (m/z 187.0224), could be tentatively annotated as Methyl \n(2E)-5-(5-methyl-2-thienyl)-2-penten-4-ynoate. It belongs to a class of \norganic compounds known as fatty acid esters. According to Trius-Soler \net al. (2023) , fatty acid ethyl esters have been proposed as candidate \nbiomarkers for ethanol. The second signal (4.38 min), m/z 387.0931, \nmay correspond to the adducts [M-H]\u0000or [M \u0087FA-H]\u0000with mass errors \nof \u00000.39 and \u00000.50 ppm, respectively. The deprotonated molecular ion \n[M-H]\u0000was annotated as 1-O-[3-(2,4-Dihydroxy-methoxyphenyl)prop -\nanoyl]hexopyranuronic acid and 4-(2-Carboxyethyl)-3-hydroxy-2- \nmethoxyphenyl hexopyranosiduronic acid. For the [M \u0087FA-H]\u0000adduct, \nvanillic acid-4- O-glucuronide, caffeic acid 3-glucoside and 1-caffeoyl- \nbeta- D-glucose could be supported by the MSMS data. Vanillic acid-4- O- \nglucuronide is a phase-II metabolite formed through the hepatic meta-\nbolism of vanillic acid. In an intervention study with red wine, vanillin \n4-sulfate and vanillic acid 4-sulfate were identified in urine samples \n(Esteban-Fern \u02d8andez et al., 2018 ) and different derivatives of caffeic acid \nhave been reported as wine-intake biomarkers (Mosele & Motilva, \n2021 ). Regarding the other two candidates for the C15H18O9 molecular \nformula, 1-caffeoyl-beta- D-glucose and caffeic acid 3-glucoside are \nhydroxycinnamic acids derived from caffeic acid, a phenolic acid \ndetected in wine. In the study by Esteban-Fern \u02d8andez et al. (2018) , 1- \ncaffeoyl-beta- D-glucose and caffeic acid 3-glucoside were not identified, \nwhereas the caffeic acid sulfate and dihydrocaffeic acid 3-sulfate were \ntentatively identified in the urine samples, being down-regulated due to \nwine consumption.\nFinally, in the reverse phase with the positive ionization mode (RP- \npos), two compounds were annotated (Table 3). The first compound \neluted at 1.45 min, with a main signal at m/z 152.0338 with a formula of \nC5H4N4O2 (2.2 ppm mass error), was annotated as Xanthine or 7H-Pu -\nrine-6,8-diol. Xanthines are purine bases found in most human body \ntissues and fluids, as well as in other organisms. The second compound \nwas detected at 3.27 min (m/z 290.1585) with the molecular formula \nC13H23NO6 and was annotated as O-adipoylcarnitine or 3-Methylglutar -\nylcarnitine. According to HMDB, both are acylcarnitine and it is believed \nthat there are more than 1000 types of acylcarnitine in the human body \nand they are involved in fatty acid metabolism.\n3.3. Comparison between targeted and untargeted metabolomics\nDifferent metabolites, related with regular wine consumption, were \nproposed based on the comparative results of the 24-h urine analysis of wine consumers vs non-consumers resulting of the both targeted \n(Table 2) and untargeted metabolomics (Table 3) approaches. It stands \nout that some of them, or at least related compounds, were detected in \nboth metabolomics approaches. However, it should be noted that the \nsensitivity of the QqQ-MS/MS detector used in the targeted metab -\nolomics is higher than the TOF (qToF) detector, which may explain the \nlower number of compounds detected in the untargeted approach. In \naddition, to prevent saturation of the TOF detector due to the presence of \nmajor compounds in urine differ from the low molecular weight me-\ntabolites studied, sample dilution (1:10, v/v) was necessary to minimize \nthe saturation of the detector.\nTo start with, in the 24-h urine of wine consumers, different hepatic \nphase-II metabolites of resveratrol were tentatively identified with tar-\ngeted metabolomics (Table 2) and their free form was also detected with \nuntargeted metabolomics (Table 3). Similarly, caffeic acid ethyl ester \nwas detected in higher concentrations in the 24-h urine samples of the \nwine consumers (Table 2) by the targeted metabolomics approach and \ntwo caffeic acid derivatives were detected in the wine consumer group \nby untargeted metabolomics (Table 3). Finding the metabolites in both \nmetabolomics approaches reinforces their tentative identification.\nUrolithin A and a phase-II metabolite of gallic acid (gallic acid sul-\nfate) were detected in higher concentrations in the wine consumer group \n(Table 2) when urine was analyzed by targeted metabolomics. Both were \ntentatively annotated in the urine of wine consumers by untargeted \nmetabolomics (q-valueD0.05). Nevertheless, their MSMS spectra were \nnot very informative and it was not possible to draw conclusions about \nthe accurate annotation of these two compounds. For this reason, these \ntwo compounds were not included in Table 3. The fact that this study \nwas carried out without diet intervention implies greater inter- \nindividual variability between samples and lower concentrations of \nmetabolites derived from wine intake than if diet intervention with wine \nhad been carried out in a controlled way.\nGenerally, dietary and health biomarkers can be classified into 3 \ngroups: exposure/intake, effect and susceptibility/host factors \n(Odriozola & Corrales, 2015 ; Gao et al., 2017 ). Intake biomarkers \nencompass the compounds present in wine (such as resveratrol), and \nthese reflect the level of wine consumption. Function or effect bio-\nmarkers refer to the functional response of the human body to an \nexposure. And susceptibility/host factors represent the individual sus-\nceptibility to an exposure, predicting the intensity of its effect on the \nindividual. Some of the biomarkers reported in this study might not be \ndirectly related to wine, but rather to the effect of the wine components \non the human body. In this sense, some proposals in Table 3, such as O- \nadipoylcarnitine/3-Methylglutarylcarnitine or Methyl (2E)-5-(5- \nmethyl-2-thienyl)-2-penten-4-ynoate (metabolites involved in fatty acid \nmetabolism) are not present in wine but rather could derive from the \nfunctional response of the human body to sustained wine consumption.\n4.Conclusions\nThe present study demonstrated that the combination of targeted \nand untargeted metabolomics approaches could be a useful tool for \nexploring biomarkers of regular and moderate wine-consumption using \n24-h urine samples from a free-living population without dietary inter-\nvention, allowing them to maintain their usual daily activities, dietary \nhabits and social interactions. The great potential of LC-HRMS for \ndetecting biomarkers of wine consumption in the context of untargeted \nmetabolomic studies was illustrated by the annotation of sixteen com-\npounds associated with regular wine-consumption. This approach en-\nables the detection of a broader range of metabolites compared to more \nclassical techniques, which are often limited in sensitivity and scope. \nUnlike targeted methods, LC-HRMS allows for the identification of un-\nexpected or novel metabolites that may serve as more accurate bio-\nmarkers of wine intake, providing a comprehensive metabolic profile \nand offering deeper insights into the biochemical impact of wine con-\nsumption. Note that none of the proposed biomarkers were detected in M. Jim\u02d8enez-Salcedo et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Food Chemistry  469 (2025)  142128  \n7 the urine samples of non-wine consumers (control group), or at least, if \nthey were detected in some of the urine samples of the control group, \ntheir relative abundance was not significant (q-valueF0.05) between the \ntwo groups. Additionally, the results of the targeted metabolomics \napproach have shown a wide range of biological phenol metabolites, \nmainly hepatic phase-II conjugates, whose concentration was signifi -\ncantly higher in the urine samples of regular wine consumers. Antho -\ncyanin and stilbene derivatives were highlighted as the most selective \nwine regular consumption biomarkers.\nHence, this study was performed as a starting point for the optimi -\nzation and subsequent evaluation of the usability of the metabolomic \nstrategies categorized into two approaches, untargeted and targeted \nmetabolomics, applied to 24-h human urine samples from a specific \ngroup from La Rioja, for the selection of regular wine consumption \nbiomarkers. Future studies should focus on the validation of these bio-\nmarkers in the broader populations.\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\nMarta Jim\u02d8enez-Salcedo: Writing \u2013 review & editing, Writing \u2013 \noriginal draft, Software, Methodology, Investigation, Formal analysis, \nData curation, Conceptualization.
