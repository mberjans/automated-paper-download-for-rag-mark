{"text": "Curcumin, a polyphenolic compound derived from the rhizome of Curcuma longa, has been extensively studied for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Recent clinical trials have demonstrated that curcumin supplementation significantly reduces inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The bioactive compound exerts its effects through modulation of nuclear factor-\u03baB signaling pathways and inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 enzyme activity. Furthermore, curcumin has shown promising results in improving joint pain and mobility in arthritis patients when administered at doses of 500-1000 mg daily.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jnutbio.2023.109123", "title": "Curcumin supplementation in rheumatoid arthritis: A systematic review", "journal": "Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry", "pmid": "37234567", "simple_sentences": ["Here are the simple sentences:", "1.
